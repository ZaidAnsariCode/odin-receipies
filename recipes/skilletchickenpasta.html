    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This chicken pasta skillet meal is a tasteful combination of vegetables,

      <li>4 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
      <li>8 teaspoons dried basil</li>
      <li>4 pinches salt</li>
      <li>4 teaspoons ground black pepper</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons ketchup</li>
      <li>2 skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into thin strips</li>
      <li>2 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
      <li>1 green bell pepper, chopped</li>
      <li>1 red bell pepper, chopped</li>
      <li>1 red onion, chopped</li>
      <li>4 cups sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
      <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat. Stir in spaghettini
        and return to a boil. Cook pasta until it has cooked through, but is
        still firm to the bite, 6 to 8 minutes. Drain well and keep warm.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in
        tomatoes; cook until they soften and begin to break down. Stir in garlic
        powder, oregano, basil, salt, pepper, sugar, and ketchup. Heat sauce
        through and reserve.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat remaining 3 tablespoons oil in a separate cast iron skillet over
        medium heat. Stir in chicken; cook until browned. Stir in garlic cloves;
        cook for 1 additional minute.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove chicken from skillet and reserve. Turn heat to high. Stir bell
        peppers, onion, and mushrooms into the skillet and cook until they begin
        to soften. Stir in browned chicken. Turn heat to medium and cook until
        chicken is no longer pink in the center and vegetables are cooked
        through, about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Toss chicken and vegetables with tomato sauce and hot pasta. Serve
        sprinkled with Parmesan cheese.
